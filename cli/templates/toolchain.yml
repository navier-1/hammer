# This is the configuration file that introduces a new compiler and/or linker to Hammer.
#
# Provide compiler and linker you want to use; either use their name (clang) or provide the
# full path to the binaries (/usr/bin/my_special_compiler)
#
# If you plan on using features like adding stack canaries and what not, tell hammer what flags
# it should pass to compiler and linker when you enable those features.
#
# This should* allow you to use any compiler and linker you like, even if hammer does not ship with it.
#
# Once you are happy with this file, run:
#
# $ hammer add-toolchain mytoolchain.yml
#
# If it respects the provided yaml schema it will get installed on your system, and now you will be able to
# use it when building with Hammer. Either hardcode it in your compilation_settings.yml or manually select
# it when configuring the build in interactive mode with 'hammer config'
#
#
#                                                          *results may vary
