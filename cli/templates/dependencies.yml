# Here is a general example of a configuration file for dependencies.
# The only obligatory fields are the 'target' binary to link against and the 'name'.
# You may optionally specify: 
#   - a related include path
#   - multiple static or shared binaries to link
#   - if the dependency is a git submodule, the path to the submodule
#
# If you don't provide any binary by specifying 'shared', 'static' nor 'submodule',
# the dependency will be treated as a system dependency and searched in the system scope.
# Otherwise the specific binary you provided will be linked.
