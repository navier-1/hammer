defines:
# To define string literals, encapsulate the double-quoted string literal in single-quoted YAML strings.
# Currently this only supports valueless defines, e.g. #define BUILDING, for conditional compilation
# Will have to figure out a clean way to allow assigning values like so: #define VAR 42
